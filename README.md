wp_weekposts_widget
===================

A simple widget to show the current week or the last week (optionable) posts. Needed that for one of my project so here it is.

I haven't found a really simple widget to show the current week's posts or the last week's posts. There are many plugins about showing
the a certain number of posts with possibility to skip some, but it's always working on the number of posts, not on the real date
of the posts.

So this widget allows you to do that, to show in your sidebar the current week (if it's thursday it will only show the posts from
monday to thursday) and/or last week's posts (same, from monday to sunday).
