# wp_weekposts_widget

A simple Wordpress widget to show the current week or the last week (optionable) posts. Needed that for one of my project so here it is.

# Why?

I haven't found a really simple widget to show the current week's posts or the last week's posts. There are many plugins about showing a certain number of posts with possibility to skip some, but it's always working on the number of posts, not on the real date of the posts.

So this widget allows you to do that, to show in your sidebar the current week (if it's thursday it will only show the posts from monday to thursday) and/or last week's posts (from monday to sunday).

# Options

There's no much options in the plugin. You can just choose "This week" or "Last week", and to show or not the date in front of the post title. Because this is exactly what I need, and it's my first widget, and building the widget was not my primary goal, so I didn't bother allowing other options.

# Possible improvements

* Instead of 2 dropdown for this week and last week, replace by an input so that it's possible to go as many weeks back as needed.
* Make the date format optionable. For now it's the name of the day (e.g. Monday) or Today, or Yesterday.

Maybe I'll change that one day, but feel free tofork and make the changes if you wish. I can pull merge.
